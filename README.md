# Mp3-player
This is a python project made by using Tkinter which is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package.
It also uses libraries like Pygame and Mutagen.
The MP3 GUI program application attempts to emulate the pre installed MP3 Player/ Audio Player. This program will allow you to play songs, music, and all MP3 files on your desktop or laptops.

The player will be able to play any song. It will be capable of playing MP3 files .The player will  allow the user to browse through the contents of the computer drive to choose song/s to be played or queued .It will provide the users with option to pause or resume the song. The user will be able to play the previous or the next song in the playlist with the change in volume. There is also a slider provided which helps us to navigate in song . At the end there is also the time on which our song is at as well as the total length of the song.
